## Mentor-Student Session Management: Back-End Repository

Visit Website

Welcome to the back-end repository for the Mentor-Student Session Management platform â€” a system designed to streamline mentor-led lectures, Q&A sessions, and student participation. This platform empowers mentors to create sessions, manage their profiles, upload lecture recordings, and communicate schedule updates efficiently, while students can register for lectures, receive notifications, and revisit session recordings.

This repository contains the Node.js/Express server code for our application, interfacing with the frontend repository.

# Back-End Repo for Node/React Practicum

This will be the API for the front-end React app part of your practicum project.

These instructions are for the **front-end team** so they can setup their local development environment to run
both the back-end server and their front-end app. You can go through these steps during your first group meeting
in case you need assistance from your mentors.

> The back-end server will be running on port 8000. The front-end app will be running on port 3000. You will need to run both the back-end server and the front-end app at the same time to test your app.

### Setting up local development environment

1. Create a folder to contain both the front-end and back-end repos
2. Clone this repository to that folder
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Pull the latest version of the `main` branch (when needed)
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Open http://localhost:8000/api/v1/ with your browser to test.
7. Your back-end server is now running. You can now run the front-end app.

#### Running the back-end server in Visual Studio Code

Note: In the below example, the group's front-end repository was named `bb-practicum-team1-front` and the back-end repository was named `bb-practicum-team-1-back`. Your repository will have a different name, but the rest should look the same.

#### Testing the back-end server API in the browser

> Update the .node-version file to match the version of Node.js the **team** is using. This is used by Render.com to [deploy the app](https://render.com/docs/node-version).
